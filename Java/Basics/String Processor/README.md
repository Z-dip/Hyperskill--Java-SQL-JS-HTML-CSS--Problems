String processorOpen on JetBrains Academy

Write a class with the name StringProcessor that extends the Thread class . The class must have a method that reads strings (line by line) from the standard input. If a read string has a character in lower case, the processor must output the string in the upper case; otherwise, the processor must output "FINISHED" and stop the processing.

Use the provided template for your class. Write any additional methods if you need them.

The testing system will start the processor as a regular thread.
