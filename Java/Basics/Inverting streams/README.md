Inverting streams
There is a new challenge. Someone has not correctly chosen the types of streams in a program (parallel and sequential).

You need to implement a method that inverses the state of every stream from the given list (parallel ? sequential and vice versa).

The method should return a new list of streams which are inverted.

Try to use streams to solve this problem.
