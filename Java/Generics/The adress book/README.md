******THIS PROBLEM WAS DELETED ON HYPERSKILLS, SO I INCLUDE DESCRIPTION HERE******

The address book
There is a program with a class representing an address book. The class provides a method that returns the Optional address of a person by its name. If the name is not present in the book, the method returns an empty Optional.

You need to complete the code to print the person's name and its address (separated by the phrase lives at) if the address is present and the "Unknown" string otherwise. It is highly recommended to use the methods of the Optional class to solve this problem.

Please do not add any additional characters in the output.
